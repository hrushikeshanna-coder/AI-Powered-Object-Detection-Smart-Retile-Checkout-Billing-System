## 🚀 Features
- Automated product detection using YOLOv8
- CNN-based product classification (VGG19)
- Confidence-based human-in-the-loop verification
- Dynamic festival-based discounts (5%–25%)
- Seasonal pricing logic
- Intelligent combo offer recommendations
- IoU-based redundant bounding box removal
- Automated itemized bill generation

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pillow
- Google Colab (GPU)
